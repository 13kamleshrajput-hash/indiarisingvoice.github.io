<h1>India’s Energy Security in a Fragmented Global Order</h1>
</section>

<section class="article-content">

<p>
Energy security is not a sectoral issue. It is a national resilience issue.
Industrial growth, military readiness, digital infrastructure, and macroeconomic stability depend on uninterrupted energy flows.
</p>

<p>
In a fragmented global order marked by sanctions, supply disruptions, and geopolitical rivalry, energy continuity becomes strategic discipline.
</p>

<h2>Import Dependence and Structural Exposure</h2>

<p>
India imports a substantial share of its crude oil requirements, creating exposure to price volatility,
maritime chokepoints, sanctions regimes, and currency pressures.
</p>

<p>
Energy vulnerability directly influences inflation, fiscal balance, and external stability.
Strategic autonomy therefore requires diversification and resilience planning.
</p>

<h2>Diversification as Policy Strategy</h2>

<p>
India has diversified crude sourcing across Middle Eastern suppliers, Russian purchases, and expanding ties with the United States.
This approach reflects procurement flexibility rather than ideological alignment.
</p>

<h2>The Maritime Security Dimension</h2>

<p>
Energy flows depend on secure sea lanes such as the Strait of Hormuz, Bab-el-Mandeb, and the Malacca Strait.
Naval capability and maritime diplomacy underpin energy continuity.
</p>

<h2>Renewable Expansion as Strategic Hedge</h2>

<p>
Solar expansion, green hydrogen initiatives, and grid modernization reduce long-term fossil dependency.
Energy transition serves both climate goals and geopolitical insulation.
</p>

<h2>Strategic Petroleum Reserves</h2>

<p>
Buffer capacity provides time during crisis. Strategic reserves enhance resilience against sudden disruptions.
</p>

<h2>Currency and Energy Linkages</h2>

<p>
Dollar-denominated oil trade links energy security with currency stability.
Diversified settlement mechanisms may gradually reduce exposure to volatility.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Energy security is long-term resilience architecture.
Diversification, maritime strength, renewable scaling, and institutional discipline determine stability.
</p>

<p>
In a fragmented order, states that manage energy strategically strengthen national leverage.
